# Self-driving-Car-steering-Angle-Prediction
Built a self-driving vehicle simulation in Unity with precision steering, dynamic speed control, and voice command integration. Optimized NVIDIAâ€™s CNN model to reduce compute and data usage, achieving a validation loss of 0.523% and outperforming traditional autonomous systems.
